As a data scientist, Dr. Patil has held prominent roles as the lead of product teams at RelateIQ (acquired by Salesforce), a founding board member for Crisis Text Line (which uses technology to provide on-demand mental health and crisis support), and a member of the venture firm Greylock Partners. He has also applied his data science expertise to a variety of other business segments, from healthcare, where he worked on the development of programs such as the Precision Medicine Initiative and Cancer Moonshot; to criminal justice, where he worked to establish reforms such as Data-Driven Justice and Police Data Initiatives that now cover more than 94 million Americans. He currently leads data efforts at Devoted Health as their Chief Data Scientist and is a Senior Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. Outside of private industry, Dr. Patil has served as a member of the faculty at the University of Maryland, where his research focused on nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. Dr. Patil has also been active in national security, both directing new efforts to leverage social network analysis and computational science to anticipate emerging threats to the U.S; and co-chairing a major review of U.S. efforts to prevent bioweapons proliferation in Central Asia. His work for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) earned him a Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the highest honor the DoD can bestow upon a civilian. In 2014, Dr. Patil was selected by the World Economic Forum as a Young Global Leader, and is currently a member of the Council of Foreign Relations. He also holds the distinction of having been appointed by President Obama to be the United States’ first Chief Data Scientist, a job that led to the establishment of nearly 40 additional Chief Data Officer roles across the federal government.","educations":[{"institution":{"summary":"High school in California, United States","image":"https://kg.diffbot.com/image/api/get?fetch=yes&url=g%3Cj7P0SttAc%3ANu.d9U%7CB%5DpM08.%7DZnIa6%40_%3Bv2FpDLhawxEr-%5BuTpJZ%40-r%3Ec2Jh9e%3EMn%3BgzYf%7EL2Oi%3B%60t%3Ba2Th","types":["Organization","Corporation","Company"],"name":"Monta Vista High School","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/EDYHKeWJmO469Wdl77GMX6w","targetDiffbotId":"EDYHKeWJmO469Wdl77GMX6w","type":"Organization"},"isCurrent":true,"degree":{"types":["Intangible","DegreeEntity"],"name":"High School or Equivalent","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/Eo0L8FrRAM1aL2Fs7j4HHUw","targetDiffbotId":"Eo0L8FrRAM1aL2Fs7j4HHUw","type":"DegreeEntity"}},{"institution":{"summary":"University based in College Park, Maryland","image":"https://kg.diffbot.com/image/api/get?fetch=yes&url=g%3Cj7P0SttAc%3ANu.d9U%7CB%5DpM08.%7DZnIa6%40_%3Bv2FpDLhawxEr-%5BuTpJZ%40-r%3Ec2Jh9e%3EN7%5Bv7m%3AQkJgxxd%2FB%5BWb88f%40Q%5ECdwZ%7BBc.Vu4","types":["Organization","Corporation","Company","OrganizationInvestor"],"name":"University of Maryland","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/EQTffT7RbPriOdiEJ3B7SBw","targetDiffbotId":"EQTffT7RbPriOdiEJ3B7SBw","type":"Organization"},"isCurrent":false,"major":{"name":"Applied Mathematics","type":"EducationMajorEntity"},"degree":{"types":["Intangible","DegreeEntity"],"name":"PhD or other Doctorate","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/ELnQKJ4qDPGicFk4Dp4r5og","targetDiffbotId":"ELnQKJ4qDPGicFk4Dp4r5og","type":"DegreeEntity"},"description":"Activities and Societies: Area of researchs: Applied nonlinear dynamics, chaos theory, and complexity","from":{"str":"d1996-XX-XX","precision":1,"timestamp":820454400000},"to":{"str":"d2001-01-XX","precision":2,"timestamp":978307200000}},{"institution":{"summary":"Public university in La Jolla, California, United States","image":"https://kg.diffbot.com/image/api/get?fetch=yes&url=g%3Cj7P0St0DnBJf.x0KwLZrUn.%5B%3CR0Aa4Hh%3B%5Bv738ZqOr7U%3FDvsQ%3Ez%5C5ch%3Em4Us7hu7I8YoJt%3DR%7BD%2CqCrEObXj5k%7COkAj.M%7E%40","types":["Organization","Corporation","Company","OrganizationInvestor"],"name":"UC San Diego","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/EsBI6uR_EO5yC9rN5CI3NkQ","targetDiffbotId":"EsBI6uR_EO5yC9rN5CI3NkQ","type":"Organization"},"isCurrent":false,"major":{"name":"Mathematics","type":"EducationMajorEntity"},"degree":{"types":["Intangible","DegreeEntity"],"name":"Bachelor's (4 year program)","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/EtWuqNi7UOGu2JRK_z95kDg","targetDiffbotId":"EtWuqNi7UOGu2JRK_z95kDg","type":"DegreeEntity"},"description":"Activities and Societies: President of Sangam 1995-1996 Volleyball Team 1993-1994 Programs of concentration: psychology, theaterResearch activities: ecology of sardine populations, geomorphology sand dunes","from":{"str":"d1993-XX-XX","precision":1,"timestamp":725846400000},"to":{"str":"d1998-05-XX","precision":2,"timestamp":893980800000}},{"institution":{"summary":"Community college in Cupertino, California, United States","image":"https://kg.diffbot.com/image/api/get?fetch=yes&url=g%3Cj7P0St0DnBJf.x0KwLZrUn.%5B%3CR0Aa4Hh%3B%5Bv738ZqOr7U%3FCvrS%3EiS%7B%7EqF%5BztiDet%3Fk6YuKt.W8J","types":["Organization","Corporation","Company"],"name":"De Anza College","diffbotUri":"http://diffbot.com/entity/EzPIoEP2ZOduLt8nTYZKgbw","targetDiffbotId":"EzPIoEP2ZOduLt8nTYZKgbw","type":"Organization"},"isCurrent":false,"description":"Started out in Jr College and realized I was pretty good at math.","from":{"str":"d1992-XX-XX","precision":1,"timestamp":694224000000},"to":{"str":"d1992-XX-XX","precision":1,"timestamp":694224000000}}],"homepageUri":"fastcompany.com/magazine/162/generation-flux-dj-patil","type":"Person","allNames":["DJ Patil","D.

Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a businessman and investor. He is the founder, chairman, CEO, and chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO, product architect and former chairman of Tesla, Inc.; owner, chairman and CTO of X Corp.; founder of the Boring Company and xAI; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. He is the wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$232 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $254 billion according to Forbes, primarily from his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.","Elon Musk is the Co-Founder, Product Architect, and CEO of Tesla. Elon Musk attended the University of Pennsylvania.","Elon Musk co-founded and leads Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company. As CEO of Neuralink, he oversees the development of ultra-high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect the human brain to computers. Previously, Elon co-founded and sold PayPal, the world's leading Internet payment system, and Zip2, one of the first internet maps and directions services.","Elon oversees the company's product strategy -- including the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles and battery products for consumers. He helped design the ground-breaking Tesla Roadster, for which he won an Index and a Global Green award. In October 2008, he took on the additional responsibility of overseeing daily operations as the company was ramping up Roadster production and accelerating the development of its second vehicle, Model S.","As of this writing Elon Musk owns roughly 24% of Tesla's outstanding shares and 43% of the privately-held SpaceX. In October 2021 Tesla's market cap broke $1 trillion for the first time. That same month SpaceX raided money at a $100 billion valuation.

As lead designer at SpaceX, Elon oversees the development of rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and ultimately to other planets. In 2008, the SpaceX Falcon 1 was the first privately developed liquid fuel rocket to reach orbit, and SpaceX made further history in 2017 by re-flying both a Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft for the first time. Soon after, Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two, completed its first flight in 2018. In 2019, SpaceX’s crew-capable version of the Dragon spacecraft completed its first demonstration mission, and the company will fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station for the first time in 2020. Building on these achievements, SpaceX is developing Starship - a fully reusable transportation system that will carry crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars and beyond -- and Starlink, which will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable. By pioneering reusable rockets, SpaceX is pursuing the long-term goal of making humans a multi-planet species by creating a self-sustaining city on Mars.
