# [Kyaria.ai](https://www.kyaria.ai/)
This project is being shut down because I don't have the time to maintain it and it was getting a bit expensive.

What is currently active:
- Resume Builder
- LinkedIn Bio writing
- Elevator Pitch writing
- Behavioral interview question prep

What is not currently active:
- Job board manager, this was using a service called Diffbot to scrape job posts. This could be brought back online if I build a chrome plugin or scraper
- Virtual career coach, this was using a service called D-ID to do avatar video streaming. This could be brought online if it was switched to just using voice.

## Tech stack:
- Vercel: CI/CD, deployment
- Next.js full stack
- Tailwind css
- Vercel Blob & Cloudinary for object storage
- MongoDB
- OpenAI: text generation
- D-ID: Avitar animation & streaming
- Textkernal: resume parsing
- Stripe
- Segment analytics (I used mixpanel for visualizations)
